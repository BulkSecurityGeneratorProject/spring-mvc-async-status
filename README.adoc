== Discussion

The relevant classes are:

* link:https://github.com/CarlosVRL/spring-mvc-async-status/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cif/web/rest/StatusResource.java[StatusResource]: the rest controller

* link:https://github.com/CarlosVRL/spring-mvc-async-status/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cif/service/StatusQueueService.java[StatusQueueService]: handles the tasking

* link:https://github.com/CarlosVRL/spring-mvc-async-status/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cif/service/StatusJob.java[StatusJob]: a "long-running" method entry-point

* link:https://github.com/CarlosVRL/spring-mvc-async-status/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cif/config/StatusExecutorConfiguration.java[StatusExecutorConfiguration]: simple executor config.

Most of the other classes are generated by JHipster,
and can be safely ignored.

The client-side code is under `entities/status`

== Ideas for Future Development

* Add a "progress-bar" for the client

* Migrate the execute-and-wait to submit and poll status

** As an aside, I intentionally designed the queue class to be blocking,
   it would be nice to decouple the wait so that I can provide more info to the user
 
* Add a cron-job to clean-up "stale" jobs that could be 
  leftover from exceptions or cancellations
